Sting Biography

Born 2 October 1951, in Wallsend, north-east England, Gordon Sumner's life started to change the evening 
a fellow musician in the Phoenix Jazzmen caught sight of his black and yellow striped sweater and decided 
to re-christen him Sting. Sting paid his early dues playing bass with local outfits The Newcastle Big Band, 
The Phoenix Jazzmen, Earthrise and Last Exit, the latter of which featured his first efforts at song writing. 
Last Exit were big in the North East, but their jazz fusion was doomed to fail when punk rock exploded onto 
the music scene in 1976. Stewart Copeland, drummer with Curved Air, saw Last Exit on a visit to Newcastle 
and while the music did nothing for him he did recognise the potential and charisma of the bass player. 
The two hooked up shortly afterwards and within months, Sting had left his teaching job and moved to London.

Seeing punk as flag of convenience, Copeland and Sting - together with Corsican guitarist Henri Padovani - 
started rehearsing and looking for gigs. Ever the businessman, Copeland took the name The Police figuring 
it would be good publicity, and the three started gigging round landmark punk venues like The Roxy, Marquee, 
Vortex and Nashville in London. Replacing Padovani with the virtuoso talents of Andy Summers the band also 
enrolled Stewart's elder brother Miles as manager, wowing him with a Sting song called 'Roxanne'. Within days 
Copeland Senior had them a record deal. But the hip London music press saw through The Police's punk camouflage 
and did little to disguise their contempt, and the band's early releases had no chart success. So The Police did 
the unthinkable - they went to America.
