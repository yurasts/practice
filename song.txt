Desert of rose

Ya leel
Ya leel
Hadaee mada tawila
Wa ana nahos ana wahala ghzalti
Wa ana nahos ana wahala
Wa ana nahos ana wahala
I dream of rain
I dream of gardens in the desert sand
I wake in vain
I dream of love as time runs through my hand
I dream of fire
These dreams that tie two hearts that will never die
Near the flames
The shadows play in the shape of the man's desire
This desert rose
Whose shadow bears the secret promise
This desert flower
No sweet perfume ever tortured me more than this
